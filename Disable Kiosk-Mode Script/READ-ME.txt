POWERED By Scrappers

this script is designed to disable the kiosk mode back in default place 

its doing that by returning back the mate-panel application to the /usr/share/applications 

you can run any application & configure your bluetooth and wifi using mate-panel then to re-enable back the kiosk mode run the JPluto Kiosk-Mode.sh script 


OR 

Actually if you double clicked '/home/jpluto/Fix Folder/mate-panel.desktop' it will disable the kiosk mode & return the mate-panel back in place
